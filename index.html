  <h3>My motivation for the ICT program</h3>
  <p>
    Since i was little i have been playing around with technology and I was a pretty curious kid and started to wonder
    how does a computer function?
    After i bought my own computer I began looking into Programming and I started my first little project making a very
    simple game. It was quit the challenge but after some trial and error I got a functional end product.
    While writing the code I had a lot of fun and after the project I felt accomplished and that made me happy.
    At that moment I decided that I wanted to do something with coding, because why not make something that you have a
    lot of fun with and makes you happy into a job.
    I started to look for colleges that were'nt that far away and have a good vibe where I felt home and I stumbled upon
    HZ.
  </p>
  <h3>Why ICT suits me</h3>
  <p>
    I have done something with coding before it was at secondaryschool the first
    and second year it was on a website called
    <a href="https://codecombat.com/" target="_blank">CodeCombat</a> and there
    with the help of some cenarios they teach the basics of Javascript, HTML and CSS
    next to CodeCombat i have also used <a href="https://www.rpginabox.com/" target="_blank">RPG in a Box</a> as a hobby
    project and RPG in
    a box allows you to more easily create a pixel game. While doing all of that i really enjoyed doing it and wanted to
    make a career out of it.
