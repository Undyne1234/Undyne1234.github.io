  <h3>My motivation for the ICT program</h3>
  <p>
    Since i was little i have been playing around with technology and since i
    was a pretty curious kid i started to wonder how does a computer function?
    So after i had aquired the bare minimum gear i began looking into Programming
    and i sarted my first little project and it was hard but after some googleling
    i got a functionle piece of code. While writing that piece of code i had a lot
    of fun tinkering with the css for that piece of code. At that moment i decided
    that I wanted to do something with coding cause why not make something that
    you have a lot of fun with and makes you happy into a job. So i satrted searching for Colleges
    that provided me with the knowlege that i so desired.
  </p>
  <h3>Why ICT suits me</h3>
  <p>
    I have done something with coding before it was at secondaryschool the first
    and second year it was on a website called
    <a href="https://codecombat.com/" target="_blank">CodeCombat</a> and there
    with the help of some cenarios they teach the basics of Javascript, HTML and CSS
    next to CodeComabt i have also used <a href="https://www.rpginabox.com/" target="_blank">RPG in a Box</a> as a hobby
    project and RPG in
    a box allows you to more easily create a pixle game. While doing all of that i really enjoyed doing it and wanted to
    make a career out of it.
